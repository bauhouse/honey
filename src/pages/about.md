## Humanizing Human Resources

HoneyBee Workforce is humanizing human resources by building resilience into a community through mentorship, support, training, and a business model that relieves the daily economic pressures of employees.

## A Strong Work Culture

Instead of treating staff as commodities, we create a culture of caring by building a community of supportive relationships, based on collaboration and shared experiences.

## A Resilient Workforce

By providing transportation for our employees, we not only relieve the financial pressures that force people to work multiple part-time jobs, but we provide a cohort of colleagues who can encourage each other in their work, drawing strength from each other by having others to hold them accountable for punctuality, a strong work ethic, and the responsibility to uphold the core values of the group.
