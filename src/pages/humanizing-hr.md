## Flexibility

- **We are the top execution tool for Human Resource Officer:** We save time (and time is money). Human resource officers focus on building the culture and nurture the current staff rather than losing sleep to recruit and deal with issues due to labor shortage.
- We are just a phone call away. You let us know who you need and when do you need, and let the triangle magic work.
- We can provide extra coverage in Peak Seasons
- **Strong Network:** Currently 227 personal in the field and database of 1700 potential candidates

## Punctuality

- **10 minute rule:** HoneyBee Workforce team shows up 10 minutes prior to the shift start.
- We coach our team towards benefits of being 10 minutes early at their shift.
