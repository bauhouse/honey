  excerpt: By providing transportation for our employees, we not only relieve the
    financial pressures that force people to work multiple part-time jobs, but we
    provide a cohort of colleagues who can encourage each other in their work, drawing
    strength from each other by having others to hold them accountable for punctuality,
    a strong work ethic, and the responsibility to uphold the core values of the group.
