  excerpt: By providing transportation for our employees, we not only relieve the
    financial pressures that force people to work multiple part-time jobs, but we
    provide a cohort of colleagues who can encourage each other in their work, drawing
    strength from each other by having others to hold them accountable for punctuality,
    a strong work ethic, and the responsibility to uphold the core values of the group.

\## Response Time and Methods

\- **Driver / Supervisorâ€™s role:** Our driver is our team lead and is fully trained to handle any kind of emergencies. He is also coach for the team and he does daily briefing to the team before dropping off at work.

\- **Response time:** Our management team is available 24 hrs via phone or email. This also means Night shifts and holidays

\## Employee Appreciation and Support Program

\- **Employee Appreciation Program (EAP):** We have our EAP which is focused on developing hard working employees even further using appreciation.

\- **Monthly Town hall Meetings:** We share information with our superstars so that they know what we are doing corporately and what were our biggest wins in past 30 days

\- **Social Assistance:** We help and support our employee by getting the credentials approved.

\## Sustainable Eco-Friendly Business Model

\- **Ride share program:** All of our superstars show up in a single van rather than separate cars.

\- **Reduced carbon foot print:** we are proud to say that we help reduce carbon foot print.

\- Approximately six ton of carbon dioxide emitted by one car each year

\- Traffic congestion, pollution and health issues

\- **Social impact of ride sharing:** we have noticed the physiological impact of ride sharing. It grows team work and there was 39% reduction in absenteeism, where ever we switched from individual cars to ride share.
